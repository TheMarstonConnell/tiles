# Tiles - A Generative Art Case Study

This project took inspiration from [Matt Willey and his Concrete Coffee Table](https://huguetxpentagram.com/matt-willey-coffeetable/). 
I absolutely loved how this looked in photographs and wanted to see if I could produce something similar but through the medium of generative art.

This project was an experiment in generative texture, color, and depth. Making flat squares feel like concrete tiles was a challenge but in the end, 
static noise with a blur filter made the tiles feel rough and glossy.
